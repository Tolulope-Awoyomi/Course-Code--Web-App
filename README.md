# COURSE CODE WEB APP

## Specification
This is a one-page HTML/CSS/JS front-end web app that accesses data from a generated db.json file using json server. 
All interactions between the client and the db.json file are handled asynchronously and uses JSON as the 
communication format. There are at least three event listeners used to enable 
interactivity in the app. They are DOMContentLoaded, submit, and click events. 
Each of the event listener has its own unique callback function.  
This app also implements at least one instance of array iteration using the map array method.

## Structuring My Code
There are five files and an image:
* An `index.html` file: contains the basic text of the app. 
* An `functionality.js` file: contains the codes that drive the app's functionality (including the function to fetch and display data).
* A `countDown.js` file: contains the codes pertaining to the countdown and clock's functionalities.
* A `db.json` file: contains a collection of 6 objects with 5 attributes.
* An `design.css` file: contains the codes used to achieve the aesthetics of the web app.
* An image `COURSECODE.png`: which is the logo for the web app.
